## Project description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The student will be graded by his/her peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 

The student is required to submit: 

 1. a tidy data set
   * I submitted **tidyMeans.txt** and I provide a copy of it in this repo [here](tidyMeans.txt).
 2. a link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis
 * This is the repo for which I submitted a link. The script for performing the analysis, called **run_analysis.R**, is [here](run_analysis.R).
 3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called **CodeBook.md**
  * The code book is [here](CodeBook.md).
 4. The student should also include a **README.md** in the repo with the student's scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 
  * This is the file you are reading.


One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
